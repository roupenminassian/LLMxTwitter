## Model Explainability

Understanding the 'why' behind model predictions is as crucial as the predictions themselves, particularly in sensitive areas like misinformation detection. To decipher the black-box nature of complex machine learning models, we employ model explainability techniques.

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

We use SHAP, a game theory approach, to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations, using the classic Shapley values from cooperative game theory and their related extensions.

### Fine-Tuned Model

We apply the SHAP methodology on our fine-tuned model, `roupenminassian/TwHIN-BERT-Misinformation-Classifier`, to gain insights into its behavior on the classification dataset.

### Implementation Highlights

- **Data Preparation**: We use the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for the classification dataset.
- **SHAP Initialization**: We utilize the SHAP Explainer to interpret the fine-tuned model's predictions.

- **SHAP Value Extraction**: We process the Shapley values to understand the importance of each feature (word or token) in making a prediction.

- **Saving Results**: The Shapley values are saved for future analysis and interpretation.
