# LLMxTwitter

## Introduction

This repository explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Twitter data. The methodology covers several techniques including data collection, data preprocessing, LLM training and inference. Further to this, there are references to model explainability to understand how these LLMs make predictions and the factors that contribute to its output. An interactive data visualisation has also been created to allow you to explore the data and gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns that have been identified.
